Once upon a time there was a little ladybug. 
She had three black dots on the right side and two black dots on the left side. 
She was a little ladybug and everybody loved her. 



The ladybug community is dying and needs the help of humans. Ladybugs don't have
good health care and as a result their average life expectancy is dwindling.
Please, if you see a ladybug on the street, give it some money. It 
will go a long way.



mayor also calls upon citizens to donate money for helping ladybug to build
their community. Under the help of warm-heated citizes, the ladybug community 
gets back to the right track. However,good times doesn's last long. The
government officials of ladybug communityt embezzle public funds, most of the 
citizens there still couldn't get appropriate health care. 



Well... the story of the ladybug with three black dots on the right side and 
two black dots on the left side came to an end. Truth is, the bad times 
advertised were just fake-news and an alternate reality 😊
The little hero of this story did just fine in the end and so 
did the ladybug-community. 
Just look:

The story is not End! The ladybug with three black dots on the right side and
two black dots on the left is actually an alien species who came to the Earth 
several million years ago to spy every living organisms around it. Now it has 
completely recalled all its memory and mission. It's time to do something.
