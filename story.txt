Once upon a time there was a little ladybug. 
She had three black dots on the right side and two black dots on the left side. 
She was a little ladybug and everybody loved her. 
End of story.





This is the end of the story of the little ladybug, 
but it is just the beginning of a great adventure. 

The ladybug community is dying and needs the help of humans. Ladybugs don't have
good health care and as a result their average life expectancy is dwindling.
Please, if you see a ladybug on the street, give it some money. It 
will go a long way.



mayor also calls upon citizens to donate money for helping ladybug to build
their community. Under the help of warm-heated citizes, the ladybug community 
gets back to the right track. However,good times doesn's last long. The
government officials of ladybug communityt embezzle public funds, most of the 
citizens there still couldn't get appropriate health care.
