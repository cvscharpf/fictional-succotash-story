Once upon a time there was a little ladybug. 
She had three black dots on the right side and two black dots on the left side. 
She was a little ladybug and everybody loved her. 
End of story.





This is the end of the story of the little ladybug, 
but it is just the beginning of a great adventure. 

The ladybug community is dying and needs the help of humans. Ladybugs don't have
good health care and as a result their average life expectancy is dwindling.
Please, if you see a ladybug on the street, give it some money. It 
will go a long way.
